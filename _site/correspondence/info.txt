Dear GAP Days Participants,

As the GAP Days are nearing we want to draw your attention to the Preparations page 

https://www.gapdays.de/gapdays2020-spring/preparation/

and would highly appreciate if you could follow its instructions BEFORE coming to St Andrews.
Should you have any issues please do not hesitate to contact us.

If you are unable to bring a computer with you to work on, please let us know now, we will try to organise access to one for you.

Should you not have access to eduroam, we need to know this ahead of time as well to organise WiFi access for you.

If there is anything you would like to check with us before GAP Days please get in touch!

Kind Regards,

Ruth, Chris and Max
