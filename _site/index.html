<h2 id="gap-days-in-general">GAP Days in general</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gap-system.org/">GAP</a> Days are meetings where developers and users
with GAP programming experience are invited to discuss, influence, and
contribute to the future development of GAP. To streamline each meeting, the
organisers usually suggest a few main topics to work on during the week.</p>

<p>The meetings are also suitable for advertising recent developments in GAP
itself, and its packages, via short talks.  However, the focus of the meetings
is on development, with talks playing only a minor role.  As enough GAP experts
will be around for advice and technical support, the meetings offer particularly
good opportunities for people to work on their own packages. At the end of the
week, we would be happy to hear about any progress you made.</p>

<p>Please visit <a href="https://www.gapdays.de">gapdays.de</a> for a list of all GAP Days.</p>

<h2 id="gap-days-spring-2020-1">GAP Days Spring 2020</h2>

<p>These GAP Days will focus on the progression/improvement of the infrastructure of the core of GAP.</p>

<p>We will also include a small number of talks during the GAP Days about the GAP infrastructure.
If there is a particular topic in this area that you would like to hear a talk about, then please include details in the comment box at registration, or email us later.</p>

<p>While we do not want to discourage non-GAP-core programmers, we want to underline that the focus will be on working on the kernel/core of GAP.
For anyone who wants to attend but feels out of depth in this, we will be looking for testers and other higher level tasks.</p>

<p>GAP Days Spring 2020 is organised by</p>
