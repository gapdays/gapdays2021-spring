Dear Participants,

After keeping a close eye on the spread of COVID-19 we have decided to move GAP Days to a fully virtual environment. 

We apologise for any inconvenience this will create and should you need a formal confirmation that we have cancelled the event to receive reimbursements from your institutions please get in touch with us.

The virtual GAP Days will be hosted using the following tools:
- Slack <https://gap-system.slack.com/> for discussions, file exchange etc.
- Jitsi Meet <https://meet.jit.si/GAPDaysSpring2020> for talks, video and audio chat
- HackMD <https://hackmd.io> for collaborative editing

Should you not have access to https://gap-system.slack.com, please let us know!

jitsi is a browser based open-source video-conferencing system (there is also
an app for Android and iOS). The recommended browser for full (and best) functionality is Chrome or Chromium. You won't have to download anything (unless you don't have Chrome).

We strongly recommend that you try out all three tools before next week, to make sure
they work.

We are aware that with this handicap we might not be able to deliver the full impact GAP Days we hoped for, but we will still try to have the talks as planned, attempt to get a few things done next week and get the ball rolling with some crucial discussions.

Please check the gapdays.de page for all up to date information!

Kind Regards,

Ruth, Max and Chris
