Dear GAP Days Participants,

As the GAP Days are nearing we want to draw your attention to the Preparations page

https://www.gapdays.de/gapdays2021-spring/preparation/

and would highly appreciate if you could follow its instructions BEFORE the start of the workshop.
Should you have any issues please do not hesitate to contact us.

Please keep in mind that is especially applicable to attendees of the first day. 
This will make it possible for your to focus on the exercises.

For those who are mainly attending for the first day; we encourage you to attend day 2 as well! You might find something that is doable and you might have time for during GAPDays. But if you don't want to don't worry we are looking forward to seeing you nonetheless.

If there is anything you would like to check with us before GAP Days please get in touch!

Kind Regards,

Ruth and Max
