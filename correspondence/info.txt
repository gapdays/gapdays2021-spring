Dear GAP Days Participants,

As the GAP Days are nearing we want to draw your attention to the Preparations page 

https://www.gapdays.de/gapdays2021-spring/preparation/

and would highly appreciate if you could follow its instructions BEFORE the start of the workshop.
Should you have any issues please do not hesitate to contact us.

If there is anything you would like to check with us before GAP Days please get in touch!

Kind Regards,

Ruth and Max
